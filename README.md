Let's start from the beginning. I found out that you could make bots for the messenger platform and was wondering why dev space around that was so slim. So i set up my dev account and started a bot named Kaffeine and made a few simple commands.

Later I found out you need to verify for the bot be truely public and receive user requests and you need to verify with your id for that. There is no way around this. I do not trust a comapany like Facebook that has such a bad track record with user data.
